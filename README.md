# Team Name: Simple Budget

## Overview
Simple Budget provides a simple interface for users to view and log their personal spending. To access their account, users will select their username from the list shown on the login page. They will then be directed to their summary page. The summary page shows an overview of the userâ€™s past spending per category and selecting a category allows the users to view a detailed list of all their recent purchases in that category. Users may also log a new purchase into a category. Input fields will include the amount spent, a short description, the date and time of purchase, and a choice of categories to log the purchase into. Simple Budget also has Admin roles to add and delete users from the application.
