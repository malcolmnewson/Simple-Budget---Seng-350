# ADR: Using Postman for API testing
### Status
Proposed

### Context
To ensure that the communication protocol between the client and server is properly designed and implemented.

// delete Why there is a need for api testing in the first place.

### Decision
Postman will be used to implement automated API testing, allowing consistent verification of correct communication between client and server. This will contribute to a quality controlled product with as few bugs as possible, as well as the [Testability QAS](https://github.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-2-1/issues/6). Postman has been chosen instead of other API testing tools such as SoapUI and Katalon studio in part due to its use in the lab component of Seng350. Some other benefits include its ability to function as a browser extension, free access for small teams, and easy to use characteristics. Because of the simplicity of this project Postman is a sufficient API tester.

//delete
What we decided on (Postman) and why (what were the benefits over other tools?). I would say something along the lines of "we used it in the labs and its easy to use".
How it helps address: https://github.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-2-1/issues/6
What were the alternatives (other api testing tools).

### Consequences
Verified API protocol between user and server.
