# Milestone 3.5: Code Iteration 2
## User Stories Added.

This sprint resulted in the completion of two administrator user stories, creating and deleting accounts, as well as a user story of uploading a purchase. There was also a significant refactor of the index.ts file into index.ts, loginControler.ts, and requestData.ts. Improved comments were added and travis ci was implemented.
