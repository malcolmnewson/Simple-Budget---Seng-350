### Build documentation
clone repository
node package manager: install all dependencies: ?npm init ??
open in webstorm, if config file is included...

### Functionality
At present, the app consists of a login page where a list of users and admin are presented. Once a user is selected they are directed to that users history page. This page displays all purchases by that users in a separate table per category If the web user selects an admin they are just directed to a json file of that database document.

### User stories
The user stories implemented for this code sprint are linked below. A user can log into their account by selecting their user name from the home page list of users. Once a user selects their account, they are directed to a history page that displays their purchases in each category. The first user story is fully implemented, but the second is not implemented to the details described in the user story. The history page just displays all of the purchases for that user in a table for each category, but without any sorting by date of purchase.
