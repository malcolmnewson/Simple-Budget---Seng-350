# Milestone 2: Detailed Design
## Build Steps
clone repository
node package manager: install all dependencies: ?npm init ??
open in webstorm, if config file is included...

## Functionality
At present, the app consists of a login page where a list of users and admin are presented. Once a user is selected they are directed to that users history page. This page displays all purchases by that users in a separate table per category and sorted in reverse date. If the web user selects an admin they are directed to a simple list of users. Eventually this will changed to allow the admin to create or delete users. 

## User stories
The user stories implemented for this code sprint are linked below. A user can log into their account by selecting their user name from the home page list of users. Once a user selects their account, they are directed to a history page that displays their purchases in each category, sorted in reverse date order. 

[As a user I want to log into my account in order to access my data](https://github.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-2-1/issues/2)


[As a user I want to see my spending history within each category in order to see all past purchases.](https://github.com/seng350/seng350f19-project-2-1/issues/3)

Marking Guide (UPDATED)

    code compiles
    code conventions/CI from above (commented, code style, design principles)
    working demo
    (Done below)clear explanation of what user stories were satisfied in this iteration
    design as implemented follows design doc, or change rationale is present in README
    async is async when necessary
    TSLint does not complain
    test suite present/part of CI
    test coverage reasonable and meaningful
   
   ~Code compiles (no marks otherwise)
    No huge problems reported by linters and analyses
    Test coverage and quality is good
    Software principles like good naming, comments, high cohesion are followed.~
