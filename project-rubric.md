# Running Total (this will change each milestone):   42

NB: for all milestones, basic clean coding style: comments, standardized indentation, lack of code smells, is expected. Your submission and repository should show the following: 
	- Travis CI is being used (M3+)
	- a static analysis tool and linter has been applied (M3+)
	- Typescript project best practices are followed (M3+)

# Milestone 1    9 / 10

## Marking Guide	

- ASRs complete and capture
  - need to persist data
  - need to manage user state and cookies
  - security and privacy
  - usability
  - performance and latency
  - async issues

Marks deducted:

- scenarios seem to have little to no connection with the project (-2)
- poor technical writing  (-2)
- Quality of scenarios (clear analysis of stimulus, response, response measure)

## Notes M1

(explaining why marks were deducted)
-----

- some of the QAS were more functional in nature (see comments online)

# Milestone 2    16/ 20

## Marking Guide

- design cohesive and intelligent
- design solves QAR from M1
- design models follow conventions for class and activity diagrams
- design allows for future changes
- design justifies technology choices

## Notes M2

- Technical Writing could be better. The design is not well detailed as written. (-1) 
- ADR for testing does not completely satisfy the highlighted Testing QAS. (-1) 
- Incomplete design decisions for technology selection. (-2)

# Milestone 3    17/ 20

## Marking Guide	

- code conventions/CI from above
- working demo 
- clear explanation of what user stories were satisfied in this iteration
- design is visibly MVC or some justification of why not 
- async is async when necessary
- code compiles
- TSLint does not complain.

## Notes M3

(explaining why marks were deducted)

- CI is not implemented. (-2)
- Comments are missing. (-1)
